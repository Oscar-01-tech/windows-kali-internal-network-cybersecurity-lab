# windows-kali-internal-network-cybersecurity-lab
Hands-on cybersecurity lab using Windows 11 Pro and Kali Lnux to configure internal networking, enable RDP, and perform Nmap scanning and service enumeration.

This project demonstrates a virtualized cybersecurity lab environment using Windows 11 Pro as the target system and Kali Linux as the attacker system. The goal was to configure internal networking between both machines, enable a remote service on Windows, and perform Nmap scanning from Kali to enumerate open ports and verify connectivity.
